# PythonStudies
First Python studies after coming com the Portugol learning IDE

    The goal of these studies is to familiarize myself with the Python language and syntax.
My first studies were done in Portugol, a learning language in my native lang inspired by C and PHP, on an introductory course from the CESAR school about programming logic. On this project my goal is to recreate in Python the same exercises I've done in Portugol. Stick around for updates about my learning process :)
